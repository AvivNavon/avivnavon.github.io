<span style="font-size:20px;">
I hold a PhD from Bar-Ilan University, where I was jointly supervised by 
Prof. Gal Chechik and Prof. Ethan Fetaya. My academic research mainly focused on <b>multitask learning</b> and <b>equivariant weight space networks</b>, 
with a broader interest in principled approaches to deep learning. I hold an MSc in Applied Statistics and Data Science (summa cum laude), and a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics (summa cum laude), from Tel Aviv University.

I have over 10 years of industry experience, working as a Data Scientist at various domains and fields, spanning time series forcasting for transportation (<a href="https://gett.com/il/">Gett</a>) and fintech (<a href="https://www.prosper.com/">BillGuard</a>), and speech understanding and synthesis (<a href="https://aiola.ai">aiOla</a>). Currently, I work on LLMs at <a href="https://doubleai.com/">AAI</a>.</span>
