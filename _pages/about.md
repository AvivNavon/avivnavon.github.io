<span style="font-size:20px;">
I hold a PhD from Bar-Ilan University, where I was jointly supervised by 
Prof. Gal Chechik and Prof. Ethan Fetaya. My academic research mainly focused on <b>multitask learning</b> and <b>equivariant weight space networks</b>, 
with a broader interest in principled approaches to deep learning.
<br><br>

I hold an MSc in Applied Statistics and Data Science (summa cum laude), and a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics (summa cum laude), from Tel Aviv University.

I have several years of industry experience, working as a Data Scientist at various domains, such as mobility (<a href="https://gett.com/il/">Gett</a>) and fintech (<a href="https://www.prosper.com/">BillGuard</a>). Currently, I am the <b>Research Team Lead</b> at <a href="https://www.aiola.ai/">aiOla</a>, where I lead initiatives in <b>speech understanding</b> and <b>speech synthesis</b>. 
My work spans the development of novel IP, applied research, and publications in conversational AI, with a strong focus on bridging cutting-edge research and real-world deployment.
